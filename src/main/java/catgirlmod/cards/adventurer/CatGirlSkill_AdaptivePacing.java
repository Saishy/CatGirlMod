    /*
     * "Hey, I wanna make a bunch of cards now." - You, probably.
     * ok cool my dude no problem here's the most convenient way to do it:
     *
     * Copy all of the code here (Ctrl+A > Ctrl+C)
     * Ctrl+Shift+A and search up "file and code template"
     * Press the + button at the top and name your template whatever it is for - "AttackCard" or "PowerCard" or something up to you.
     * Read up on the instructions at the bottom. Basically replace anywhere you'd put your cards name with CatGirlSkill_AdaptivePacing
     * And then you can do custom ones like $ {DAMAGE} and $ {TARGET} if you want.
     * I'll leave some comments on things you might consider replacing with what.
     *
     * Of course, delete all the comments and add anything you want (For example, if you're making a skill card template you'll
     * likely want to replace that new DamageAction with a gain Block one, and add baseBlock instead, or maybe you want a
     * universal template where you delete everything unnecessary - up to you)
